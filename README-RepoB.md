## Life Expectancy Data Analysis
## Project Overview
Life expectancy is a key indicator of a country's overall health and well-being. Understanding the factors that influence life expectancy can provide invaluable insights for policymakers, public health officials, and researchers. This project aims to analyze life expectancy data to identify significant predictors of low life expectancy and provide actionable recommendations for improvement. By leveraging data-driven insights, countries can prioritize areas that will most effectively raise their population's life expectancy.
## Objectives
Identify Predicting Factors: Analyze various factors such as immunizations, mortality rates, financial indicators, social determinants, and health-related issues to determine their impact on life expectancy.
Country-wise Analysis: Highlight the major predictors for each country and provide tailored recommendations.
Data Visualization: Use advanced visualization techniques to present the data in an accessible and actionable manner.
Recommendations: Develop a comprehensive strategy to guide countries in addressing areas of concern for improving life expectancy.
## Dataset
We will use the [Life Expectancy Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kumarajarshi/life-expectancy-who) provided by the World Health Organization (WHO), available on Kaggle.
